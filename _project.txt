==================
	Affiliates
==================

	- When you installed WordPress via Bluehost, you did it through the MOJO Marketplace. There was a button 
	  to "Activate Affiliate Account" at the bottom. (There was also a button to "Activate StoreFront" if you
	  ever want to sell anything...)
	

============
	TODO
============

	- Learn about developing your own theme (which might have the side benefit of being sold on Envato):
	
		+ http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development
	
	- Decide on a solid theme. The WordPress theme directory is the official location of *free* WordPress themes that
	  have been checked and inspected: http://wordpress.org/themes/.
	  
	  Candidates include:
	
		+ http://wordpress.org/themes/hemingway
		
		+ 
	
	- Decide on the pages for the site:
	
		+ About
		
		+ Resources (i.e. affiliate links)
		
		+ Comment Policy?
		
		+ 
	
	- Create some categories for your posts?
	
		+ 
	
	- Investigate and possibly install these plugins:
	
		+ Enhanced Admin Bar with Codex Search
		
		+ Jetpack
		
		+ Akismet
		
		+ 
	
	- Read this article about dealing with comment spam: (http://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Spam)
